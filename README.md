#Game Of Life
A very simple implementation of Conway's Game of Life with Python and Pygame

##About 

Conway's Game of Life is a cellular automaton designed by the British mathematician John Conway. Often called a zero-player game, the 'game' simulates the growth of cells from an initial state by following a very simple set of rules.
Each Generation:

1. Living cells with fewer than two live neighbors die
2. Living cells with two or three live neighbors live on
3. Living cells with more than three live neighbors die
4. Dead cells with exactly three live neighbors become alive

These simple rules can create very intricate patterns.
For more information on The Game of Life, see it's [Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life) and [LifeWiki](http://www.conwaylife.com/wiki/Main_Page).

##Running
This application depends on Python version 2.7, NumPy version 1.8, and Pygame version 1.9.1

[NumPy Download] (http://www.scipy.org/scipylib/download.html)

[PyGame Download] (http://pygame.org/download.shtml)

Once the dependencies have been installed, simply open game_life.py with Python.
##Usage
Click on any cell to toggle it from dead to alive or vice versa.
Press the space bar to start and pause the simulation.
